[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `enroll`, `use`, `forget`, `status`, `doctor` and `statusline`.
- Live usage in `status`, asked of Anthropic for every enrolled account at once, with
  which accounts can be switched to and until when.
- `enroll <label> --sign-in` on an enrolled label renews its parked login.
- `rename` changes an account's label; its parked login stays as it is.
- A switch refuses a parked login that has expired instead of installing it.
- `doctor` checks every parked login, and reports an interrupted switch.
- `--json` on every command, emitting a versioned envelope with stable error codes, also
  for a mistyped command line.
- Shell completions and a man page, generated from the command definition.
- Linux support, using a file vault for parked logins. Not yet confirmed against a
  signed-in Claude Code on Linux.
- An audit log of every change pitboard makes.

### State file
- Schema 3: one parked login per account, with when it expires. Earlier files are refused
  rather than migrated; nothing was ever released that wrote them.
